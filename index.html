                    <li>local organizers that want to do something to help

                        sprint would help, and how it might be different than
                        organizing their typical events. or thinking about
                        adding a focused sprint to a camp.
                    </li>
                    <li>contributors want to know what happens at this kind of
                        sprint, want to know if attending is something they
                        should try and do, and what it would be like
                    </li>
                    <li>contributors to other free software projects who want
                        insight into what the Drupal is doing and how it works

                    <li>project managers who think their skills are not needed,

                    <br>so you will remember them.</p>

                <h1>audience</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>decision makers in organizations that want to do
                        something to help release happen faster, want to host or
                        sponsor a sprint
                    </li>
                    <li>local organizers that want to do something to help
                        release happen faster, want to know if them holding a
                        sprint would help, and how it might be different than
                        organizing their typical events. or thinking about
                        adding a focused sprint to a camp.
                    </li>
                    <li>contributors want to know what happens at this kind of
                        sprint, want to know if attending is something they
                        should try and do, and what it would be like
                    </li>
                    <li>contributors to other free software projects who want
                        insight into what the Drupal is doing and how it works
                    </li>
                    <li>organizers of past focused sprints who want to add their
                        knowledge
                    </li>
                    <li>contrib maintainers who are thinking about D8 upgrade or
                        feature sprints
                    </li>
                    <li>project managers who think their skills are not needed,
                        but who could contribute to getting release to happen
                        faster
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>We think you will get something valuable out of the talk.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>* not-yet contributors, have heard of sprints, want to
                        know what the big deal is about sprints
                    </li>
                    <li>* business, sales, and marketing people who are not
                        making the money decisions
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>... are welcome but not might be getting what they
                    thought they would get out of attending the talk
                <br>Totally ok to get up and move to another talk.

                        from release, ratio can be more weighted toward people

                        that the event will be comfortable, and worth the time.
                        investing days of what might be unpaid work is a big

                        put tooooooo much pressure on one person to be good at

                        have had a key person who is both a domain expert and
                        has project manager skills. When it is the same person,
                        it puts more demands and stress on a person. In the same
                        way we want experienced contributors, we need project
                        managers with experience with core.
